## Background
The assignment was to creat a Pokemon website with Angular. Idea is that user chooses trainer name and logs in to the website.
Then the user can view Pokemon and add them to the users collection. The website had to include:

- Login page
- Trainer page
- Pokemon catalogue page

### Requirements for the pages:

1. Login page should be the landing page and user can't have access to two other pages without logging in.
2. Trainer page should list all the pokemons and their images which are included in the users collection list.
3. In trainer page user has option to remove pokemons from the users collection list.
4. User has to have option to logout in trainer page and this must return user to login page.
5. Pokemon catalogoue page lists all the pokemon and their images. User has option to add wanted pokemon to users collection.
6. If a pokemon is stored to users collection pokemon list the catalogoue page should indicate that pokemon as owned.

## Install

You need to have Angular installed and the npm in your computer. Then you need to just clone the repository to your Ide. 
For the first time you need to use **npm install** to get all the dependecies and then you can run the page in localhost with **ng serve**.

Our page is also running in [heroku](https://pokemon-trainer-jojo.herokuapp.com/).
